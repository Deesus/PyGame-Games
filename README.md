###### [Play Pong here](http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user41_IEECkGySF5_0.py) | [Play Blackjack here](http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user41_G8fEB3jjfc_0.py)

A few simple games for Python:
- A recreation of the classic game, Pong.
- Blackjack (player vs dealer).

It uses the graphical libraries, SimpleGui, SimpleMap, and SimplePlot -- which are based on [PyGame](http://www.pygame.org/hifi.html) library. However, it is easier (and recommended) that you develop/play using CodeSkulptor (which already has these libraries setup).

### Pong:
- It is 2-player only (bring a friend)
- Each new round randomizes the ball's velocity
- The ball speeds up as the rally prolongs

##### Instructions:
- On the [game page](http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user41_IEECkGySF5_0.py), click the play icon on the navigation to run the script.
- Right paddle is controlled by keyboard 'up'/'down'. Left paddle is controlled by 'w'/'s'.

### Blackjack:
- This is a 1-player game (vs computer).
- The counter on the bottom keeps track of wins/losses.

##### Instructions:
- On the [game page](http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user41_G8fEB3jjfc_0.py), click the play icon on the navigation to run the script.
- The player's actions are the buttons located on the left: 'deal', 'hit', and 'stand'.
