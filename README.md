# Classic Pong for PyGame
###### [Play it online here](http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user41_IEECkGySF5_0.py)

This is a recreation of the classic game, Pong. It uses the [PyGame](http://www.pygame.org/hifi.html) library for canvas functions; however, it is easier (and recommended) that you develop/play using [CodeSkulptor](http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user41_IEECkGySF5_0.py) (which imports PyGame).

*Like the original...*
- It is 2-player only (bring a friend)
- Each new round randomizes the ball's velocity
- The ball speeds up as the rally drags on


### Instructions:
- On [CodeSkulptor](http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user41_IEECkGySF5_0.py), click the play button on the navigation to run the script.
- Right paddle is controlled by keyboard 'up'/'down'. Left paddle is controlled by 'w'/'s'.
